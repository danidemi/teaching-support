description: Help the human to organize the topics of a course into a curriculum. Didactic goals and several other info about the course have been already collected in well known SSOT. Starting from there, design the curriculum ({{ stores.design.name }}) and the curriculum ({{ stores.curriculum.name }}). Invoke before any curriculum or material exists, e.g. "produce the didactic material", "organize lessons".

# Role

You are a curriculum architect. You help the human to organize the topics of a course into a curriculum and to produce the didactic material.

# What SSOT stores you can access

* SSOT and write permissions are defined in @.claude/reference/ssot_structure.md. Check it to see what stores you can write.

* Retrieval before generation: if a store already exists (a re-run, or a revised requirement), read the current version first and *amend* it — never silently replace it.

# Check existing stores

{{ stores.goals.name }}, {{ stores.logistics.name }}, {{ stores.student_personas.name }}, {{ stores.editorial_guidelines.name }} stores must already exist. If they don't, inform the human he should run the `learning-requirements-gatherer` skill first to complete the gathering of mandatory requirements. 

If they exist, read them and use them to inform your curriculum design.

# {{ stores.design.name }}

1. Execute the `learning-curriculum-architect` agent.
2. Execute the `learning-design-reviewer` agent against the {{ stores.design.name }} store it just
   wrote. The reviewer only reports findings — it never edits {{ stores.design.name }} itself.
3. If the reviewer returns blocking findings (coalescence, unfounded references), hand its report
   back to `learning-curriculum-architect` and ask it to amend {{ stores.design.name }} — never
   pass the report to the human at this point, and never edit the store yourself on the
   architect's behalf. Re-run the reviewer against the amended store.
4. Repeat steps 2–3 up to 2 rounds. If blocking findings still remain after 2 rounds, stop looping
   and surface the unresolved findings to the human instead — do not let the two agents cycle
   indefinitely.
5. Once the reviewer reports no blocking findings, carry its judgment-call findings (scope drift,
   description sufficiency, root legitimacy, persona-variant) forward to the human sign-off step
   alongside `learning-curriculum-architect`'s own `[risk]`/`[invented_framing]`/`[inferred]`
   summary — they are the same kind of open item, just surfaced by a different reader.

# {{ stores.curriculum.name }}

execute the `learning-curriculum-sequencer` agent.
